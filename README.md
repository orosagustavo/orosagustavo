## üíª My Story
I started programming in 2018 during high school. I took some Python courses to explore this new world and develop applications related to the subjects I was studying at the time, such as the classic quadratic equation calculator.

When I entered the Physics program in 2020, my desire to learn grew, as the challenges also became greater. This sparked my interest in simulations and data visualization, leading me to resume my programming studies in an unstructured way. In 2023, with the rise of Artificial Intelligence, I became curious about the mathematical models behind it and wanted to understand how they work.

Today, I have returned to the basics to formalize and structure my knowledge, aiming to develop new projects and explore new possibilities.

## üîé Past Research and Work Areas ([Lattes](http://lattes.cnpq.br/0146348413076979))
### Special Relativity
From **2021 to 2022**, I worked with Einstein's Special Relativity, developing studies and geometric analyses of Rindler spacetime. My main focus was the analysis of accelerated particles within the framework of Special Relativity.

### Quantum Mechanics/Quantum Information
During **2023-2024/1**, I worked with Quantum Information, seeking solutions to the Dynamic Wigner's Friend Problem, which led me to work directly on developing algorithms for **quantum computers**.

## üßë‚Äçüî¨ New Directions - Applied Physics
After concluding my work in Quantum Information, I transitioned to the Applied Physics Laboratory, where I contribute to simulation models, calculating complex Physics problems and developing visual interfaces to enhance comprehension. Besides simulations, I am also exploring ways to apply Machine Learning models to analyze the generated data more efficiently.
